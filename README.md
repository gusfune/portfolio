This project is based on [gatsby-starter-2column-portfolio](https://github.com/praagyajoshi/gatsby-starter-2column-portfolio) by [praagyajoshi](https://github.com/praagyajoshi) with a series of customizations:

- Updated from Gatsby v1 to v2.
- Reorganized components according to Gatsby V2 and my personal needs.
- Linked project to Contentful API to pull Projects dynamically.
- Added Redux to control states.
- Has a neat dark theme working around.
