# Hi, I'm Gus Fune

I'm a CTO who delivered over 100 products to scale. Currently I am leading the product & dev team of [Courate](https://www.courate.co/) a new e-commerce startup in Stockholm ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª

I can fix hard-to-find bugs, test design changes in the browser, and automate anything my team needs to get done faster.

Iâ€™ve delivered over 100 projects for clients like 3M, Coca-Cola, Behold Studios, BMW, Heineken, McDonald's and Motorola. Iâ€™ve also worked with early-stage startups on everything from product research to hiring, team-building, and even accounting.
